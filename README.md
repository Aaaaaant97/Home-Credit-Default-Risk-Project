# Project 1: Credit Risk Assessment System Based on Feature Engineering and Ensemble Learning

Our team selected the **Home Credit Default Risk** problem from Kaggle to work on. The source codes are organized into two main components:

- `Feature_Engineering`: Focusing on data preprocessing and feature construction.
- `Model_Development`: Containing base models and model ensembling.

You can check each folder for more detailed scripts.
